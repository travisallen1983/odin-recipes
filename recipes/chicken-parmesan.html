        <h1>Chicken Parmesan</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
        <p>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</p>
        <p>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</p>
        <p>Chicken breasts pounded to 1/2 inch thickness, seasoned with salt and pepper and coated in flour</p>
        <p>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p>
        <p>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</p>
        <p>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</p>
        <p>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
